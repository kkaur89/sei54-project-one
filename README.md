## Project Overview

Connect 4 is a game where players attempt to make a line of four pieces in a 7 x 6 grid. Players can drop their pieces into columns, so that their piece rests in the lowest available space in that column.

This classic game has been created with a twist, taking my love for all things luxury, each player does not have a coin to throw but instead a designer bag to place on a shelf. The aim was to feel like the player is in a store environment in the handbag section of Selfridges.
